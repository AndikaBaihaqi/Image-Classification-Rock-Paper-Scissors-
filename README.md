# Image-Classification-Rock-Paper-Scissors-

Here i try to make a model algorithm that can classify rock-paper-scissors types using CNN. In this project, I explore how we can use CNN and transfer learning to build an image classifier. The dataset consists of 2188 images that classified by Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
